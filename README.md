Milestone-1:
This is an e-commerce website that will serve as an online storefront for users to explore and purchase products easily. The platform will feature categories, filters, and a search function to help users find what they’re looking for. Each product will have a detailed page with descriptions, images, and reviews. I’ll include secure user accounts for personalized experiences and a streamlined checkout process with multiple payment options like Stripe and PayPal. The design will be mobile-responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices.
Tech Stack:**
REST API : It is a great way to ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend while maintaining a scalable and modular architecture
Frontend: React.js: enhances the user experience by creating a fast, dynamic, and responsive interface.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js: They enable efficient handling of server-side operations, making it easier to build APIs, manage data, and ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend.
Database: MongoDB:its flexibility, scalability, and ability to handle complex, hierarchical data structures
USER Authentication: JWT or OAuth for secure user login

## Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page

In Milestone 2, we focused on setting up the basic structure for our e-commerce application and building the first user-facing feature: the Login Page. Here's a summary of the key steps taken:

### Project Setup
1. **Folder Structure**:
   - We created a well-organized folder structure for both the frontend and backend:
     - `frontend/`: Contains the React application for the user interface.
     - `backend/`: Contains the Node.js server to handle API requests.

2. **React Frontend Setup**:
   - Initialized a React application using `create-react-app` to start building the user interface.
   - Installed and configured necessary dependencies for the frontend, including `react-router-dom` for routing.

3. **Node.js Backend Setup**:
   - Set up a simple Node.js server using Express to lay the foundation for API integration in future milestones.
   - Installed necessary dependencies like `express` and `cors`.

4. **Tailwind CSS Configuration**:
   - Integrated Tailwind CSS to streamline styling and make the design process easier with utility-first classes.
   - Configured Tailwind with PostCSS and added custom configurations for better responsiveness and custom themes.

### Login Page Development
- Built a functional and styled Login Page using React and Tailwind CSS.
- The page includes:
  - Input fields for the username and password.
  - A submit button that triggers form validation and simulates login functionality.
  - Basic styling using Tailwind CSS classes to make the page responsive and user-friendly.

### What's Next?
- In the upcoming milestones, we will:
  - Set up proper user authentication with the backend.
  - Implement features like user registration, product listing, and checkout.

### Submission
- All code changes have been committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.
- The repository is publicly accessible and includes the `frontend` and `backend` directories.
- The Login Page is functional and styled as per the requirements.

### How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Ecommerce-Follow-Along.git
