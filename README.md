# Milestone 4 - User Model, Controllers & File Uploads

## Introduction 🚀
Welcome to Milestone 4! In this milestone, we will focus on enhancing our backend by implementing a User Model, setting up controllers to handle user-related data, and enabling file uploads using Multer. By the end of this milestone, you will have a structured way to store user data, manage interactions, and support file uploads.

---

## Learning Goals 🎯
By the end of this milestone, you will:
- **Create a User Model**: Define the structure of user data in the database.
- **Create a User Controller**: Manage user-related operations such as adding and retrieving user information.
- **Enable and Configure Multer**: Implement file uploads to store user profile pictures or other files.
- **Update the README file**: Document your progress effectively.

---

## Key Concepts 📌
### 1. What’s a Model?
A **model** is like a blueprint that defines how data is stored in the database. In MongoDB, we use **Schemas** to structure our data.

- Example: A **User Model** may include fields like `name`, `email`, and `password`.
- This ensures consistency in how data is saved and retrieved.

### 2. What’s a Controller?
A **controller** is responsible for handling user interactions with the application. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the database.

- Example: When a user signs up, the controller handles the request, processes the data, and saves it to the database.
- Think of it as a **manager** that directs requests and responses efficiently.

### 3. File Uploads with Multer
Multer is a middleware for handling file uploads in Node.js applications.

- It enables users to upload profile pictures or other documents.
- It stores files in a designated folder and provides access to them when needed.

---

## Steps to Complete Milestone 4 📝
This milestone includes the following steps:

1. **Create the User Model**
   - Define a schema for user data using Mongoose.
   - Ensure fields like `name`, `email`, `password`, and `profilePicture` are included.

2. **Create the User Controller**
   - Implement functions to handle user-related actions such as registering a user and retrieving user data.

3. **Set Up Multer for File Uploads**
   - Configure Multer to allow users to upload files.
   - Store uploaded files in a designated folder.
   
4. **Update the README File**
   - Document the new changes made in this milestone.
   - Provide clear instructions on how to use the new features.

---

## Submission Guidelines 📥
To complete this milestone, follow these submission steps:

✅ Push your code to the same GitHub repository used for previous milestones.
✅ Ensure your repository is **publicly accessible**.
✅ Update your **README file** with a section summarizing Milestone 4.
✅ Submit your repository link as per the assignment requirements.

---

## Next Steps 🚀
In the next milestone, we will introduce **more advanced features** to enhance your app! Keep up the great work, and feel free to reach out for help if needed.

Good luck, Kalvians! ✨
