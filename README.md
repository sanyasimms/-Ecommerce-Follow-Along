🚀 Ready for the next milestone


📌 Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend
In this milestone, we successfully set up the backend for our Ecommerce project using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

✅ Achievements in this Milestone
Set up a Node.js backend server using Express.
Configured the server to listen on a designated port.
Integrated MongoDB for efficient data storage.
Established a connection between the server and MongoDB to confirm successful integration.





Milestone 6: Secure User Signup Backend

Overview

Welcome to Milestone 6! 🎉 In this milestone, we are focusing on creating a backend endpoint for the Signup page. This includes securely storing user data and encrypting passwords before saving them to the database.

Learning Goals 🎯

By the end of this milestone, you will:

Understand how to encrypt passwords before saving them.

Learn how to store complete user data securely in the database.

Why Encrypt Passwords?

Encrypting passwords is crucial for maintaining security and protecting user information. Here’s why:

Protect User Data: Keeps passwords safe even if the database is compromised.

Privacy: Ensures that user passwords remain confidential.

Compliance: Adheres to security regulations like GDPR and PCI-DSS.

Prevents Password Theft: Makes it difficult for attackers to guess or retrieve passwords.

Steps for Milestone 6 📝

1. Encrypt the Password

Use bcrypt to hash the user’s password during signup.

Store the hashed password in the database instead of plain text.

2. Store Complete User Data

Save all user details (e.g., name, email, etc.) securely in the database.

Ensure the password remains encrypted when stored.

Technologies Used 🛠️

Node.js

Express.js

MongoDB (Database)

Mongoose (ODM for MongoDB)

bcrypt (Password hashing library)
