   - # Milestone 24: Order Confirmation Page

## Project Overview
In this milestone, we have implemented the **Order Confirmation Page** for our e-commerce application. This page displays the details of the order, including the selected products, delivery address, and total price, along with a "Place Order" button to finalize the purchase.

## Learning Goals üéØ
By completing this milestone, we have:
- Created an order confirmation page in the frontend.
- Displayed the list of ordered products.
- Showcased the user's selected delivery address.
- Calculated and displayed the total value of the cart.
- Implemented a "Place Order" button.

## Implementation Steps üìù
1. **Display Ordered Products**
   - Fetched and displayed the products added to the cart.
   - Included product details such as name, price, and quantity.

2. **Show Selected Delivery Address**
   - Retrieved the user's chosen delivery address.
   - Displayed the address in a user-friendly format.

3. **Display Total Cart Value**
   - Calculated the total price of the items in the cart.
   - Showed the total amount to the user.

4. **Implement Place Order Button**

   - This will trigger the backend order processing flow.
